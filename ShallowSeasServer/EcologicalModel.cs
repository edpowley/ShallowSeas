* A dynamical spatial fish-comunity model.  Developed for implementation in the ShallowSeas game.               *
*                                                                                                               *
*                                                                                                               *
* PREAMBLE                                                                                                      *
*                                                                                                               *
* The code takes a set of species: nspp is the number of species;  nspp=2 for now.                              *
*                                                                                                               *
* Each species can have a number of life stages, to allow different life histories; nstage is maximum number    *
* of life stages.  Have set nstage=3 for now, and put in parameters to make:                                    *
* Species 0 a small fish that reaches maturity quickly: a low-value forage fish.                                *
* Species 1 a fish that grows to a larger size and takes longer to mature: a high-value fish when mature.       *
*                                                                                                               *
* Coexistence of the species becomes a potential issue because species interact. Have put in an interaction     *
* matrix for weighting  the effects of the intra- and inter-specific predation. This has the form (for          * 
* two species):                                                                                                 *
*   alpha  =    1   a                   a = 0: species are independent                                          *
*               a   1                   a = 1: species do not discriminate in their feeding.                    *
* You tune the strength of interaction between species by altering the value of 'a' from 0 to 1; 'a'=0.5 for    *
* now.                                                                                                          *
*                                                                                                               *
* Time t goes in discrete steps.  Have been working towards a time step of 1 day, trying to get ecological      *
* parameters acting slowly enough on this time scale (fishers' dynamics operate much faster than the ecology).  *
* The grid is updated synchronously, in two steps each day:                                                     *
*   1. birth, death and growth events within cells                                                              *
*   2. movements between cells                                                                                  *
*                                                                                                               *
* I've done a bit of checking and haven't found serious errors.  But it's a good idea to treat code I write     *
* with plenty of scepticism, until you have checked it yourself.                                                *
*                                                                                                               *
*                                                                                                               *
* BIRTHS DEATHS AND GROWTH                                                                                      *
*                                                                                                               *
* Dynamics of birth, death and growth are given through transition matrices (based on Leslie and Lefkovich      *
* matrices).  These dynamics operate within cells.  Each row and column in the matrix corresponds to a life     *
* stage, and non-zero elements give the transitions between and within stages.  The basic updating is           *
* N(t+1) = A * N(t), where A is the matrix and N is a vector containing the densities of indviduals in          *
* each life stage.  The transition matrices have to be fully specified.                                         *
*                                                                                                               *
* I put in place different procedures while building ideas about the transition matrices.  These are labelled   *
* leslie0(), leslie1(), leslie2().  The dynamics get more intricate and 'interesting' as you go through         *
* the sequence of models below, and I'm now using leslie2().                                                    *
*                                                                                                               *
* LESLIE0 has fixed values for matrix elements -- no feedbacks -- species either increase without limit,        *
* or they die out                                                                                               *
*    A0    =    0    10                 Species 0 has two life stages: juvenile, adult; egg production is 2;    *
*               0.1  0.1                survival from juvenile to adult is 0.1; survival as adult is 0.1.       *
*                                                                                                               *
*    A1    =    0    0    50            Species 1 has three life stages: juvenile, intermediate, adult.  Same   *
*               0.1  0    0             interpretation of the parameters.  Has a leading eigenvalue = 1 by      *
*               0    0.1  0.5           coincidence.                                                            *
*                                                                                                               *
* LESLIE1 has a density-dependent feedback to controls species                                          *
*    A0    =    0       20              p00(N) = 0.05*exp(-0.05*N[1]), where N[1] = N0[1]+N1[1]; i.e. p00 goes  *
*               p00(N)  0.1             down as the summed density of the species in life stage 1 goes up.      *
*                                                                                                               *
*    A1    =    0       0      100      p10(N) = 0.05*exp(-0.05*N[1])                                           *
*               p10(N)  0      0        p11(N) = 0.20*exp(-0.05*N[2])                                           *
*               0       p11(N) 0.5      p10 is like p10; p11 goes down as density of life stage 2 goes up       *
* These feedbacks are a minimal concession to reality, that bigger fish eat smaller fish so the proportion      *
* surviving to the next life stage is reduced the more fish there are in that stage.  Each species now comes    *
* to equilibrium when the other species is absent.  When both species are present species 1 eliminates 2;       *
* coexistence is unfinished business.                                                                           *
*                                                                                                               *
* LESLIE2 has density-dependent feedback, and tries to set parameters nominally as 1 iteration = 1 day.  There  *
* is now no correspondence between time and life stage, so there are non-zero terms all along the diagonal to   *
* deal with updating of densities within life stages.  This is rough and ready at the moment.                   *
*    A0    =    q00(N)  0.1             q00(N) = 0.999 - (1.0 - exp(-0.01*N0[1, x, y]))                         *
*               0.001   q10(N)          q01(N) = 0.999 - (1.0 - exp(-0.01*N0[1, x, y]))                         *
																												*
*    A1    =    q10(N)  0      0.1      q10(N) = 0.999 - (1.0 - exp(-0.01*N1[2, x, y]))                         *
*               0.001   q11(N) 0        q11(N) = 0.999 - (1.0 - exp(-0.01*N1[2, x, y]))                         *
*               0       0.05   0.9988                                                                           *
* Here N0[1, x, y] = alpha * N[1, [x, y], where N[j, x, y] is the species vector of densities at life stage j,  *
* and Ni[j, x, y] is the species vector of densities at stage j on stage i, after weighting by alpha, the       *
* interaction matrix.  Again, feedbacks here are a minimal concession to reality.  In this case, bigger fish    *
* eat smaller fish so the proportion surviving in the current stage is reduced the more fish there are in the   *
* next stage.                                                                                                   *
*                                                                                                               *
* To do: Another feedback in which fish grow faster if there are more smaller fish.  That's the counterpart     *
* to death from predation, and could go in on the subdiagonals.                                                 *
*                                                                                                               *
*                                                                                                               *
* MOVEMENTS                                                                                                     *
*                                                                                                               *
* Cells are linked by movement of fish.  This calls for an assumption about the boundary.  For simplicity, and  *
* to check things, I assumed periodic boundary conditions.  This will need to be changed for the game.          *
*                                                                                                               *
* For now, a fixed proportion 0.001 move between cells in each iteration.  Have written the code to allow more  *
* interesting behaviour in the future, such as small fish moving away from big fish (to reduce predation),      *
* and big fish to moving towards smaller fish (to get more food).                                               *
*                                                                                                               *
